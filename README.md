# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

A powerful and visually appealing **content-based movie recommender system** that suggests similar movies based on text features like genres, overview, and title. Built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit, and enhanced with real-time movie data using the TMDB API.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a content-based filtering recommender system that:
- Recommends 5 similar movies based on your input
- Fetches real-time posters, ratings, genres, and overviews from TMDB API
- Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for calculating similarity between movies
- Displays results using an interactive and responsive Streamlit interface

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Recommend top 5 similar movies
✅ Show poster, title, rating, genre, and overview
✅ Clean UI using Streamlit columns
✅ TMDB API for real-time movie data
✅ Machine Learning pipeline built using TF-IDF + cosine similarity

---

## 💡 Machine Learning Approach

- **Model Type:** Content-Based Filtering
- **Vectorization:** CountVectorizer
- **Similarity Metric:** Cosine Similarity
- **Tools:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Data:** MovieLens (with TMDB metadata enrichment)
